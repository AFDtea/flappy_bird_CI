# flappy_bird_CI-CutomGame&Agent

This branch is the files used to attempt to create and implement my own FlappyBird environemnt through gymnasium as well as a custom agent and model.

There are a large number of issues, mainly the returning of the observation from the game to the agent and the calculating of the Q values inside the model.
However, I will attempt to rectify these issues in the near future.
